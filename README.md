# carparkingmanagement
I develop this, Car parking Applicationis for both customers and parking owners..
Initially there is no parkinglots and users are there. You have to signup as a owner and add your parking lot and then signup as user then book your parking spaces.
Main menu is 1.Login,2.SignUp and 3.Exit
Owners menu is AddParking , ViewParkings and logout.
Users Menu ViewBookings ,Get booking ,Close Booking and Logout.
This application design is based on MVC design pattern using JAVA.
The main Starting page is on carparkingmanagent/login/loginView.java
User and owners related process are happens in carparkingmanagement/user package
All POJO classes are placed in dto file.
